# Changelog for Highcharts v11.1.0 (2023-06-05)

- Added support for mouse wheel zooming through [chart.zooming.mouseWheel](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.zooming.mouseWheel). This feature is embedded in the [Highcharts Stock bundle](https://code.highcharts.com/stock/highstock.js), but requires an [additional module file](https://code.highcharts.com/modules/mouse-wheel-zoom.js) for the [Highcharts bundle](https://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js).
- Added the [heatmap.interpolation](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.heatmap.interpolation) option for creating smooth heatmaps.
- Added new function, [Chart.getOptions()](https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Highcharts.Chart#getOptions), to get the current active configuration options for the chart.
- Added the [treegraph.fillSpace](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.treegraph.fillSpace) option for treegraphs to fill the whole plot area even when some points are collaped.
- Added `borderRadius` option support for funnel and pyramid series. See [#18839](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/18839).
