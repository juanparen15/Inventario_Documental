# Changelog for Highcharts Stock v11.1.0 (2023-06-05)

- Most changes listed under Highcharts 11.1.0 above also apply to Highcharts Stock 11.1.0.

## Upgrade notes
- For Highcharts Stock, the ordering of series and axes in the `chart.series`, `chart.xAxis`, `chart.yAxis` and `chart.axes` arrays were changed. Previously the navigator series and axes were last of the initial items, and when adding items they were appended. From now on, the internal navigator series and axes are always last, so the index of items now corresponds to that of the current options.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed [#18459](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/18459), dragging annotations on chart with ordinal axes was inconsistent.
- Fixed [#19042](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/19042), text of annotation label was missing after updating it.
